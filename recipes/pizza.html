    <h4>Steps to recreate:</h4>
    <ol>
      <h4>Pizza Dough</h4>
      <li>Mix flour, yeast, salt and sugar, then mix in water and oil.</li>
      <li>
        It will come together into a rough dough that leaves the bowl pretty
        clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scrape out onto a floured work surface and bring it together into a
        ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead for 5 minutes using your hand or 3 minutes in a stand mixer.
      </li>
      <li>Drizzle the same bowl with olive oil, then put the dough in.</li>
      <li>
        Cover with cling wrap and rise 1 hour in warm place. Once the dough has
        risen, use immediately or refrigerate up to 5 days for even better
        flavour!
      </li>
      <li>Scrape dough out of bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Shape into a log, knocking out all the air, and cut into 3 equal pieces,
        tuck the sides of the dough underneath, money-bag style;
      </li>
      <li>Place on a tray, then cover with a damp tea towel</li>
      <li>
        Rise for 1 hour in a warm place until almost doubled in size. If your
        dough was in the fridge, this will take 3 – 4 hours (because the dough
        needs to come to room temperature first before it will start to rise).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <h4>Cheese Sauce:</h4>
      <li>
        Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional – just makes sauce thicken faster).
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix
        constantly for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into
        the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. Use a
        whisk if needed to make it lump free.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly
        after a few minutes until sauce thickens – about 5 – 8 minutes. It
        should coat the back of the wooden spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the
        cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable –
        the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over
        the Ragu when layering). If it’s too thick, add a splash of water or
        milk.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <h4>Assemble:</h4>
      <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.</li>
      <li>Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x 2.5″ baking dish.</li>
      <li>
        Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with lasagna sheets. Tear
        sheets to fit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu (enough to cover sheets), then drizzle
        over 1 cup of Cheese Sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with lasagna sheets (Note 7). Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of
        Ragu, then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1
        more time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, then pour over the remaining
        Cheese Sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and
        bubbling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving, garnished with
        basil or parsley if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
